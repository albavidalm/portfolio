### Further implementations

Soon I will add a button to toggle the portfolio in Dark or Light mode.
I also want to implement a functionality to switch between English and Spanish.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Grid
- Sass
- React
- React Hook Form
- EmailJS
- Responsive

### Setup

- Once you've download or cloned the project, install it with:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- After that, if you want to run it in local execute this command:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### What I learned

I extended my CSS and Sass knowledge plus was the first time I used EmailJs.
