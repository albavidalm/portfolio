  "description": "Hi! My name is Alba and I like to create online things. Although I didn't know what web development was yet, my interest in it started some time ago when I was trying to customize Blogger and Tumblr themes.I focused my professional career on administration and business management and during these years I have improved and enhanced my ability to solve problems, organization, self-learning and adapting to change (as when I went to work in a clothing shop in another country).<br/>Some time ago, after having made some WordPress websites, my programming bug started growing again so I took some courses on my own (a vice I still have) until I finally finished my Web Application Development bootcamp at Adalab.<br/>If I'm not programming I'm probably reading, learning to play the piano, doing Crossfit or looking for a weekend plan.",
